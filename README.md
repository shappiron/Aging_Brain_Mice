# Aging_Brain_Mice
Study aging chromatin in mouse cortex tissue.
This is a collection of notebooks that undertakes various analysis and comparisons based on cooler files with Hi-C contact data, in addition to ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and SNP profiles.
The main aim is comparison of different strata of cell populations in the mouse brain cortex, however the notebook design is flexible and adaptable to tasks with comparable aim and scope.
All necessary packages are documented in the enviroment file. 
Go through the preparator notebook first and the explorer second.
